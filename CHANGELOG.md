# Changelog

## 0.1.1

* minor fixes and cleanup
* added more comments to config variables
* changed `useDefaultRoutes => true` to `disableDefaultRoutes => false` (the configuration to disable all default routes)
* added `setConfig()` function to overwrite defaults with options from GUI

## 0.1.0

* initial release
* I rewrote [Monoplane](https://github.com/raffaelj/Monoplane). While trying to make it multilingual in its update branch, I decided, that the code base was too ugly.
